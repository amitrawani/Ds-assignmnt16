    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you \n",
    "to work with that data very efficiently. It is categorized under the NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval \n",
    "of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems.\n",
    "Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in several scenarios:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.Flexible Data Models: MongoDB's document-oriented structure allows for flexible and dynamic data models. If the application \n",
    "    deals with constantly changing data structures or unstructured data, MongoDB can provide a more natural and scalable solution compared \n",
    "    to SQL databases.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.Big Data and Real-time Analytics: MongoDB's scalability, flexibility, and native support for distributed computing frameworks make\n",
    "    it a popular choice for handling big data and real-time analytics workloads.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.Geospatial Data: MongoDB has robust support for geospatial queries and indexing, making it suitable for applications that deal \n",
    "    with location-based data, such as mapping, logistics, or geospatial analytic.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.Agile Development: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for faster development iterations and adaptability to evolving requirements. \n",
    "    It eliminates the need for migrations and schema modifications common in SQL databases, making it easier to iterate and prototype \n",
    "    applications."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans: Here are some key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "1.Document Model: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in flexible, self-describing JSON-like documents\n",
    "called BSON (Binary JSON). This model allows for easy representation of complex hierarchical relationships and supports dynamic schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scalability and High Performance: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers or clusters. \n",
    "It can handle large datasets and high traffic loads, providing scalability and high performance. It also offers automatic sharding to \n",
    "partition data and distribute it across multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Flexible Schema: MongoDB's schema flexibility allows for agile development and easy data evolution. It doesn't require a predefined \n",
    "schema, allowing documents within a collection to have different structures. This flexibility simplifies handling of evolving data models \n",
    "and eliminates the need for expensive schema migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Querying and Indexing: MongoDB offers a powerful query language with a wide range of querying capabilities. It supports rich queries\n",
    "including ad-hoc queries, indexing, and advanced querying features such as text search and geospatial queries. Indexes can be created\n",
    "on any field, enabling fast retrieval of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides a comprehensive aggregation framework that allows for complex data transformations and analysis.\n",
    "It supports pipeline stages, including filtering, grouping, sorting, joining, and statistical operations, making it efficient for \n",
    "performing advanced analytics on large datasets."
